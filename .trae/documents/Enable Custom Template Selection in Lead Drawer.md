I have successfully updated the **Website Template Modal** to support your custom uploaded templates.

### **What's New:**

1. **Custom Templates Integration**: The "Create Website" modal now fetches your uploaded templates from the database and displays them alongside the standard ones.

   * They are marked with a generic icon and a placeholder gradient for now.

   * Selecting one will use your custom HTML when generating the site.
2. **Upload Shortcut**: Added a new **"Upload / Manage Templates"** button directly inside the modal.

   * This provides a quick link to the Templates management page so you don't have to navigate away manually.

### **How to Use:**

1. Go to **Leads**.
2. Click **"Create Website"** on any lead.
3. You will now see your uploaded templates (if any) at the top of the list.
4. If you need to add a new one, just click the **"Upload / Manage Templates"** button.
