# ⚠️ DEPRECATED DIRECTORY

**STOP! Do not edit files in this directory.**

This `supabase` directory is legacy/root configuration that conflicts with the active project.
The active project has been consolidated into the `blue-rocket-dash` directory.

## Where to find code now:
- **Functions:** `../blue-rocket-dash/supabase/functions`
- **Config:** `../blue-rocket-dash/supabase/config.toml`
- **Frontend:** `../blue-rocket-dash/src`

## Changes Made:
- `send-test-email` has been moved to `blue-rocket-dash`.
- `lead-qualifier` logic (Telegram) has been merged into `qualify-lead` in `blue-rocket-dash`.
- Shared code has been copied to `blue-rocket-dash`.

Please perform all `supabase functions deploy` commands from the `blue-rocket-dash` directory.
